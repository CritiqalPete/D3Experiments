D3Experiments
=============

This repo is about reworking great designs by MBostock et al for my own exploration in data-viz at Stupid Fun Club and beyond.
The changes, in my opinion, aren't valuable enough to create a branch, yet.

## Most of these items involve only slight modifications of examples created by others. This is how I learn.
## The repo is pretty much ad hoc experiments and studies with what little free time I have working with Will Wright at the Stupid Fun Club.
## If anyone finds something useful here, identifies code that I haven't properly cited/credited, please do feel free to contact me directly, at peter@napofearth.com
## If you have developed a kinesthetic, interactive, and visually appealing method of managing personal data and security across the Internet, then I'd like to see that too.
